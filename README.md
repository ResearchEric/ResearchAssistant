                Task Management and Documentation App
---------------------------------------------------------------

Description:
-------------
This app is designed to manage tasks and generate documentation for a project using a series of AI-powered agents. The app takes an initial objective and generates tasks based on this objective. It then prioritizes, executes, and adds context to these tasks, ultimately producing well-organized documentation in the form of an HTML document.

  - .env
  - README.txt
  - documentation.html (generated by the app)

Setup:
------
1. Ensure that you have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies using pip:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Create a .env file in the app directory, and add the following variables:
   - OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the project
   - INITIAL_TASK: The initial task to start the project

Usage:
------
1. Navigate to the app directory and run the app using the command:
   python app.py
2. The app will execute the tasks and generate an HTML documentation file named documentation.html in the app directory.

Note:
-----
This app is powered by GPT-4, and some of its agents might require a connection to the GPT-3.5 API. Please make sure you have access to the required APIs and have set up the necessary API keys before running the app.
